- **Logo**: The application features a custom logo designed in Figma, which enhances the visual identity of the application.
- **Header and Footer**: Each page includes a consistent header and footer to provide easy navigation and branding.
- **Fluid Layout**: Elements such as entries and buttons use percentages for widths rather than fixed pixel values, allowing them to scale with the screen size.
